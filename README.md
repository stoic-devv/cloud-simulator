# Kanthale, Aditya Devendra - HW 1
We use [cloudsimplus](https://github.com/manoelcampos/cloudsimplus) framework to simulate various resource allocation and provisioning scenarios. We also simulate the SaaS, PaaS and IaaS models of cloud computing.
Lastly, we explore how multiple datacenters in a network topology communicate and serve the cloudlets. This project is done as a part of CS 441 - Distributed Cloud Objects at UIC.
